## 📝 Notes
- Built to practice **React fundamentals** like state, props, and mapping lists.

- The UI focuses on displaying search results, keeping the app lightweight and simple.

## 🛣️ Possible Improvements
- Add loading and error states for a smoother UX.
- Debounce input so API calls aren’t triggered on every keystroke.
- Replace `window.location.href` with proper `<a>` tags for accessibility.
- Paginate results or add infinite scroll for large datasets.
- Improve accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA roles).
- Add unit and integration testing using **Jest** and **React Testing Library**.
- Add better empty-state handling when there are no results.
